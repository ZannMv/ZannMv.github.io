# 🎯 - Considerations

> The project has a preview of a login and registration system. This system was all done with JS, as mentioned before, only as a preview. It is necessary to adapt or remove it to use in your project because it was added since it was mandatory in the college project. The Checkout system **WAS NOT** added for obvious reasons.

> Made ♥️ by Henry8K and team.
